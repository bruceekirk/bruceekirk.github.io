<p>Dear ——,</p>

<p>I hope you are well, and I apologize in advance if this lengthy inquiry is ultimately impossible to fully address given its highly complex and potentially controversial nature. </p>

<p>In an effort to be as straightforward as possible: I am writing to you (in your role as Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion) out of a sense of curiosity with respect to the question, “What is your official position on the scope of activities allowed for on-campus student interest groups?” (<em>i.e.</em> “Where do we draw the line?”)  </p>

<p>This question is prompted by an email I received late last week from the “———@LISTS.UCDENVER.EDU” account. As a current student and former employee for several years, I’ve often received email advertisements for research study enrollment requests, the Wednesday food truck lineup, and outdoor yoga invitations from this campus-wide mailing list, but I was surprised last Thursday to find an announcement from the Catholic Medical Association (CMA) regarding a screening this Wednesday (10/30) of the film <em>Unplanned</em> in Building —. (For clarity, I’ve attached to this email a PDF, the first page of which is the aforementioned CMA document.)</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that I am an advocate for free speech, especially in the on-campus environment; in fact, I am a member of the Heterodox Academy (our mission statement concludes with: “I support viewpoint diversity, mutual understanding, and constructive disagreement in my academic ﬁeld, my institution, my department, and my classroom.”). Although my political leanings and social perspectives are overwhelmingly liberal, progressive, and secular, I would be disturbed by efforts to silence those who disagree with me. That said, I am particularly sensitive to any form of official speech by Anschutz campus associates that runs contrary to the basic goals of the University in terms of medical and scientific accuracy, justice, and patient autonomy. </p>

<p>The motivation for my question (“where do we draw the line?”) as it relates to the <em>Unplanned</em> screening originates from the intent of the film itself. My gut reaction was that this film is a propaganda piece for anti-abortion advocates, but after discussing my concerns with family and friends this weekend, I decided to watch the movie to develop a well-informed opinion before contacting you. Having experienced the near two-hour runtime of the film last night into this morning, I no longer need to speculate as to its contents: it is indisputably propaganda. Simply put, <em>Unplanned</em> is starkly problematic for a host of reasons, which I hope to elucidate here. </p>

<p>First, and most importantly: does propaganda (in any form) have a place on the medical campus? Here, I use the term propaganda to relate an intent to mislead for effectively political purposes; by political, I mean pertaining to social relationships involving power or authority. Our medical campus, in part, represents a devotion to the search for truth. From my perspective, sponsoring (even if only tacitly) a screening of <em>Unplanned</em>, or any piece of propaganda without the added context of academic analysis of such material <em>as propaganda</em>, is entirely contrary to that commitment to veracity, and it seems counterproductive to allow students to present targeted medical misinformation as if it is a reasonable basis for discussion while actual scientific consensus is ignored. </p>

<p>Definitionally, propaganda is intended to sway its targets on political issues using falsehoods — <em>Unplanned</em> does exactly this. The film includes several portrayals of both chemical and surgical abortion (the first only a few minutes into the movie) that are gratuitously stylized to depict <em>all abortions</em> as being horrific, traumatic, and wildly dangerous. Moreover, <em>Unplanned</em> repeatedly endorses <a href="https://www.acog.org/-/media/Departments/Government-Relations-and-Outreach/FactAreImportFetalPain.pdf">medically inaccurate information</a> regarding fetal pain responses, going so far as to visually imply that a 13-week old fetus will attempt to cling to the inside of the uterus during surgical abortion as an apparent (and entirely fictitious) defense mechanism (PDF 2-3). </p>

<p>These intentional distortions of reality work to perpetuate dangerous misunderstandings and myths surrounding abortion. I was able to view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPSJedjGqvs">a teaching video</a> of a pregnancy termination by vacuum aspiration (the same surgical technique represented with spectacular disingenuousness in the film) for comparison. <em>Unplanned</em> visualizes termination of pregnancy at 13 weeks on ultrasound using images of a fully-developed newborn, and where the real-life equivalent of this procedure uses a handheld aspirator, the film includes an apparatus akin to a blender to add particularly disturbing and factually inaccurate visual flair to these sequences. Regardless of modality, abortion is represented consistently with massive blood loss as an apparently representative side effect, be it from a Plan B pill at home or an undiagnosed uterine perforation in the clinic (PDF 4-6).</p>

<p>In another affront to the truth, <em>Unplanned</em> cartoonishly villainizes Planned Parenthood (PP) employees. Throughout the film, PP is shown to play an intensely coercive role in directing family planning outcomes towards abortion, which is patently incongruous with reality (although this likely goes without saying by now). Some choice quotes from the movie include, “My job as clinic director was selling abortions” (this monologue continues into likening such work to selling timeshares),  “Our growth targets are to double last year’s total on elective terminations” and “Non-profit is a tax status, not a business model” (suggesting that PP is somehow secretly a for-profit business aimed at performing the maximum number of abortions possible rather than a non-profit organization dedicated to providing comprehensive healthcare for women). </p>

<p>In one scene, a physician performing abortions in the PP clinic directs a nurse to administer an unnecessary bolus of anesthetic so that the patient will not remember their mismanagement of emergent abortion-related blood loss (the clinic director explains that calling an ambulance would be “bad press”); when the nurse voices her concern, the physician yells, “I don’t care if you’re comfortable! Just do it.” To me, this is an atrocious and needlessly harmful misrepresentation of real-life physicians (like my maternal-fetal-medicine preceptor) who work tirelessly to provide outstanding reproductive healthcare.</p>

<p>At its core, the goal of <em>Unplanned</em> is to convince viewers that abortion is at-best extremely immoral and at-worst murder, making it especially striking to me that the invitation email was sent to the campus-wide “activities-announcements” mailing list. Statistically speaking, a non-zero number of recipients of that email have received abortions; I strongly doubt that any of them would have elected to be invited to a film that suggests they “killed a baby” by undergoing such a procedure, nor would they endorse the film’s perspectives on “the sin of abortion,” which is compared to slavery, segregation, and the Holocaust. From my perspective, if medical students, staff, or faculty want to organize to watch a piece of religious propaganda (the explicit moral of which is “You’re not doing your duty as a Christian/Catholic if you’re not actively trying to prevent women from having abortions”), campus is not the proper location to do so. As an aside, it may come as no surprise that the personal account upon which the film is based <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/the-convert/">may have been fabricated</a>. </p>

<p>Regardless of a campus affiliate’s religious or political leanings, demonizing other healthcare workers or patients (whether they are abortion recipients, providers, or otherwise) seems wildly unprofessional and inappropriate. Beyond professionalism, though, is the more fundamental issue of the intent of <em>Unplanned.</em> Nothing in the film is designed to be thought-provoking or fodder for discussion (after all, these aren’t the objectives of propaganda); rather, the movie is focused exclusively on using medical misinformation to sway a political base. As such, is it the official policy of the SOM or Anschutz campus at large that organized student groups can engage in activities on campus that are effectively antithetical to the mission of the medical science community? The specter of “free speech” looms large with such a question, but I am of the opinion that careful consideration of potential detriments to patient care takes priority over one’s right to speech in the context of being a health professional.</p>

<p>In this vein, would it be acceptable for an “alt-right interest group” to screen <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> or <em>Triumph of the Will</em> on the medical campus considering the racist motives of those propaganda films? Similarly, would a “Jehovah’s Witness interest group” made up of religious medical students be allowed to host an event calling for the elimination of blood transfusions for all patients on the basis of falsified data? I would expect not. These are extreme and possibly absurd analogies, and I don’t intend to come across as overly reductive, but I fail to see a meaningful distinction between racist, homophobic, anti-abortion, or any other propaganda if the shared outcome is that certain populations are faced with discriminatory or unnecessarily restrictive policies or individual behaviors. To me, advertising any anti-patient ideology seems unacceptable, especially when said ideology is enforced by disinformation (<em>i.e.</em> propaganda).</p>

<p>Viewpoint diversity is vital to robust discourse and higher education in general. That said, the “zone of helpfulness” regarding viewpoint diversity on abortion, especially on a medical campus, is (in my opinion) somewhat limited. Would it be useful in terms of viewpoint diversity for a team of aerospace engineers to include a flat-earther? This is not to say that I have any issue with CMA in general as an official organization — I believe that Bible Study, discussions of bioethics, and related activities are well within their purview on the Anschutz campus. Rather, I would suggest that efforts to proselytize on controversial issues like abortion should be minimized (especially when using a campus-wide mailing list) and such activities should be restricted to off-campus meetings amongst interested students. Otherwise, the presence of activities like screening <em>Unplanned</em> on campus sends an implicitly negative message about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/opinion/abortion-clinic-doctor.html">patient autonomy and justice</a> with respect to abortion.</p>

<p>If CMA were sincere in wanting to host an event featuring medically accurate information, the documentary <em>Lake of Fire</em> is an apolitical film that handles the difficult subject of abortion with impressive honesty. However, considering the upcoming screening of <em>Unplanned</em> and a recent CMA-sponsored screening of <em>Gosnell</em>, I do not believe that this group has any interest in abortion beyond proselytizing on campus, which I feel does nothing but encourage already-divisive feelings on such controversial issues. From conversations with other students, I’ve gathered that CMA has come to you before with complaints regarding discrimination towards their group on-campus; it seems to me that my question here and their concerns are directly related and are reminiscent of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2006/07/21/july-21-2006-dr-francis-collins/15186/">Dr. Francis Collins’s comments</a> on believing in intelligent design as a medical scientist: “I think this will be an argument which ultimately will not do damage to science; it will do damage to faith. The problem is the examples that intelligent design puts forward we are learning a lot about. And the notion that those are examples of irreducible complexity is showing serious cracks.” The same holds true for abortion (especially in the context of “when life begins,” which is a central conceit of <em>Unplanned</em>) or any other complex issue rooted in both philosophy and science, particularly as it relates to religiopolitical perspectives. This is discussed at length in the article “Bad Science Hurts Catholic Physicians” (PDF 7). In this case, “bad science” is generous — <em>Unplanned,</em> as genuine propaganda, is “no science.”</p>

<p>On a final note, access to abortion is becoming increasingly restricted across the United States and women are left with fewer reasonable options for family planning-related medical care. In my opinion, medical students, physicians, and representatives of the Anschutz campus at large should be among the least likely individuals to advocate for positions that are not explicitly in favor of patient rights. As outlined in the <a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/deans-office/diversity-inclusion/about-us/diversity-plan">CU Anschutz SOM Diversity Plan</a>, major focuses of our Institution include “[promoting] cross-cultural understanding and an inclusive climate” and “[enhancing]…cultural competency in the health care workforce.” From my perspective, fair-minded, scientifically sound discussions regarding abortion could be phenomenal examples of working towards these goals, but (very unfortunately) an on-campus screening of <em>Unplanned</em> achieves the exact opposite by supporting medical misinformation in service of an anti-patient-choice political agenda. Many thanks for taking the time to read this absurdly long email, and I would be more than happy to discuss this in person.</p>

<p>Respectfully, <br/>
