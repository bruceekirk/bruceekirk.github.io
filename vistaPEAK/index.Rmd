# Introduction {-#introduction}

Many thanks to the 2019 Vista PEAK senior design class and Mr. Benedict for allowing me to mentor you on your projects!

You can navigate from this page to individual project pages using the sidebar, which you can hide by clicking the icon in the top left corner of the page. Every project section ends with a summary recommendation. Some projects have more linked articles than others, but this has nothing to do with the quality of any project. Rather, some projects lend themselves more readily to being justified by academic research; some projects are based more on common sense or solving an industry-specific problem. You guys are all doing a great job and I'm impressed with everyone's hard work.

A note on academic research: These papers can be tough to approach. They're densely formatted and full of jargon, but they're still an important resource. I've done my best to pick the most relevant elements out of these articles for you guys, but I'd challenge you to read through a few of them and see if you find anything interesting. This kind of peer-reviewed literature is difficult to publish and requires a significantly deeper understanding of the subject material than any other form of writing. If you're looking for the truth, these kinds of articles (which you can easily find on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)) are where to look.

**Remember!** Sometimes, new investigations change the way we think about something scientifically. Generally speaking, the most recently published high-quality research is usually a good first resource. 

As always, feel free to contact me with any questions you might have about working in science and medicine or attending college, medical school, or graduate school: [bruce.kirkpatrick@colorado.edu](mailto:bruce.kirkpatrick@colorado.edu).

One other thing: I might've made mistakes in putting these together. If you find typos or incorrectly-linked pages that need clarification or correction, just let me know.
