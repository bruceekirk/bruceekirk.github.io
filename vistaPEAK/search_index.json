You can navigate from this page to individual project pages using the sidebar, which you can hide by clicking the icon in the top left corner of the page. Every project section ends with a summary recommendation. Some projects have more linked articles than others, but this has nothing to do with the quality of any project. Rather, some projects lend themselves more readily to being justified by academic research; some projects are based more on common sense or solving an industry-specific problem. You guys are all doing a great job and I’m impressed with everyone’s hard work. A note on academic research: These papers can be tough to approach. They’re densely formatted and full of jargon, but they’re still an important resource. I’ve done my best to pick the most relevant elements out of these articles for you guys, but I’d challenge you to read through a few of them and see if you find anything interesting. This kind of peer-reviewed literature is difficult to publish and requires a significantly deeper understanding of the subject material than any other form of writing. If you’re looking for the truth, these kinds of articles (which you can easily find on Google Scholar) are where to look. Remember! Sometimes, new investigations change the way we think about something scientifically. Generally speaking, the most recently published high-quality research is usually a good first resource. As always, feel free to contact me with any questions you might have about working in science and medicine or attending college, medical school, or graduate school: bruce.kirkpatrick@colorado.edu. One other thing: I might’ve made mistakes in putting these together. If you find typos or incorrectly-linked pages that need clarification or correction, just let me know. "],
["alzheimers.html", "Alzheimer’s App Mobile App Development (2013) Universal Design (2015) Mobile Reminders (2015) Protecting Cognition (2016) Brain Plasticity (2017) Promise of Technology (2018) Summary Recommendations", " Alzheimer’s App A mobile application designed for cognitive training and reminders for elderly patients with neurodegenerative conditions (i.e. Alzheimer’s disease) and status updates for their families. Mobile App Development (2013) This paper supports your idea that a mobile app could be useful for Alzheimer’s patients. It also does a great job outlining the challenges you might encounter in implementing this idea. “Mobile App Development and Usability Research to Help Dementia and Alzheimer Patients.” Yamagata et al. Institute of Electical and Electronics Engineers. 2013. [.pdf] Big Idea: People with Alzheimer’s can get agitated, especially in the evening, but some evidence supports that they can be comforted by visual and auditory stimulation. Keep in mind: these patients might have dementia-related issues with fine motor coordination, so your app design needs to be very easy to physically navigate. Universal Design (2015) You guys can take inspiration from this paper addressing different elements of the neurodegenerative experience with app functions: “Universal Design with Mobile App Development: Bridging the Gap for the Forgotten Populations.” Nezerwa et al. Institute of Electical and Electronics Engineers. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: There are already some good examples of apps to draw from, especially in terms of consolidating features. This paper emphasizes that auditory and visual stimulation are both needed for optimal cognitive stimulation! If you have time, glance through this one. Mobile Reminders (2015) This is actually not a great paper (it’s written in pretty broken English), but it has some good ideas regarding a system that allows family members to track food, water, and prescription medication intake. “A Mobile Reminder System for Elderly and Alzheimer’s patients.” Dalbouh et al. International Journal of Computer Science Issues. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: You’ve got a lot of good options in terms of user interface design and functionality, and it’s a great selling point that deploying this kind of app through the App Store makes for a far broader reach than physician-centered care. Protecting Cognition (2016) This paper actually used a computer-based cognitive training tool to confirm that it had a positive memory effect in Alzheimer’s patients. “Protecting cognition from aging and Alzheimer’s disease: a computerized cognitive training combined with reminiscence therapy.” Barban et al. International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: This just quantifies that your idea could improve functional abilities in Alzheimer’s disease patients. Check out this paper if you’re interested in what they included in their cognitive training. Brain Plasticity (2017) This study uses functional MRI to demonstrate that cognitive training slows down Alzheimer’s disease progression. It’s a super-dense paper, but it’s good evidence that this app would actually work. “A Pilot Study on Brain Plasticity of Functional Connectivity Modulated by Cognitive Training in Mild Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.” Barban et al. Brain Sciences. 2017. [.pdf] Big Idea: The figures and text are both so intensely science-y in this paper that I’m not going to bother including either, but it showed that cognitive training improved “whole-brain functional connectivity in subjects at risk of developing AD and in patients during the early stages of this disease.” Promise of Technology (2018) This is a full thesis (almost 70 pages long), but it has a lot of great content. Specifically, it has a well-researched 5-page review of current technologies relating to improving cognition in Alzheimer’s disease and a research proposal including cognitive training, physical training, companionship, and daily task reminders. “Seniors Living with Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia: The Promise of App Technology.” Lu. Major Papers. 2018. [.pdf] Big Idea: No figures or text from this one, either, but it justifies that seniors are increasingly adept at using technology (and so diseases of the elderly like dementia should be addressed with technology). Summary Recommendations People with Alzheimer’s disease (and those elderly patients who are at risk of developing the disease) benefit from combined visual and auditory stimulation, especially during periods of agitation (“sundowning” at dusk). Look through examples in the literature regarding app design and function and come up with a blend of app capabilities informed by the needs of these patients. Don’t forget – elderly people with dementia will probably struggle to use a touchscreen, so this needs to be as easy to navigate as is possible. "],
["walker.html", "Multi-Surface Walker General Comments Mobility and Quality of Life (2011) Enhancing Independence (2013) Walking Aids and Falls (2015) Walking in Relation to Mortality (2018) Summary Recommendations", " Multi-Surface Walker A walking mobility device designed for the active elderly in multi-surface applications including indoor, outdoor, and icy surfaces. General Comments There are some cool ideas out there related to improving walker/rollator technology. One example is these easily attachable walker “skis:” A similar technology exists for rollators: You guys might also check out these webpages: luxury rollators and walkers and an advanced walker safety system, as well as the brochure for an “active rollator.” Mobility and Quality of Life (2011) This paper shows that mobility is highly correlated with quality of life and feelings of autonomy, which is great foundational evidence that an improved walker design could benefit elderly patients both physically and psychiatrically. “Mobility and quality of life in elderly and geriatric patients.” Hudakova et al. International Journal of Nursing and Midwifery. 2011. [.pdf] Big Idea: There’s an enormous (and growing) aging and elderly population. Since evidence supports that mobility is important for quality of life, we need to enable seniors to live well by providing the best possible supportive technology. Enhancing Independence (2013) This is a high-effort thesis with lots of thought put towards design. You should glance through it for inspiration, since it’s working towards the same concept as your project. “Enhancing the Independence and Mobility for the Elderly and Disabled: A New Approach for Older Users.” Henriksen. Massey University. 2013. [.pdf] Big Idea: You might consider a walk/ride (or at least walk/sit) capability for your walker. Old people get tired quickly, especially when they’re engaging in physical activity! Walking Aids and Falls (2015) This study looks at whether using a walking aid predicts for future falls. Turns out, using aids (walkers, rollators, wheelchairs) is a risk factor for falling in the future! “Understanding the Relationship Between Walking Aids and Falls in Older Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study.” de Mettelinge et al. Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: If using a walking aid is a positive predictor for future falls, you’d want the safest possible walking aid to prevent such an occurence, right? Keep this in mind with your design! Walking in Relation to Mortality (2018) Does walking (or engaging in some amount of physical activity) as an older person actually improve your chance for survival? This study shows, pretty convincingly, that it does. “Walking in Relation to Mortality in a Large Prospective Cohort of Older U.S. Adults.” Patel et al. American Journal of Preventive Medicine. 2018. [.pdf] Big Idea: Scooters might be safer than walkers, but being sedentary (not getting any physical activity) increases your likelihood of dying sooner as an elderly person. Summary Recommendations Check out the examples I linked of existing high-quality multi-surface walkers and rollators. You might find some good ideas to include in your project! Big takeaways from the research are: Older people are happier and live longer when they’re active and more independent (both of which might be enabled with a walker or similar walking aid). At the same time, using a walking aid positively predicts for future falls, so you need to be careful in your design to maximize safety for the user. "],
["sleepy.html", "Sleepy Steery Drowsiness Estimation (2015) Sleepy Driving Behaviours (2015) Drowsy Behavior Detection (2016) Detection of Fatigue (2016) Crash Risk Perception (2016) Summary Recommendations", " Sleepy Steery A heart-rate monitoring device intended to monitor and prevent sleepy driving. Drowsiness Estimation (2015) This investigation looked at eight young (early 20s) men’s heart and respiratory rates as they drove four 50-minute sessions in a simulator after eating a big meal. By tracking these physiologic parameters, the study was able to determine how accurate they were for predicting drowsiness. “Drowsiness Estimation Under Driving Environment by Heart Rate Variability and/or Breathing Rate Variability with Logistic Regression Analysis.” Igasaki et al. International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: 81% accuracy between the two parameters is pretty good! With this in mind, you might want to measure respiratory rate in addition to heart rate with your device. Sleepy Driving Behaviours (2015) Drowsiness is indicated by factors beyond heart and respiratory rate. This paper looks at some of them and examines whether or not they predict for a driver’s use of a sleepiness countermeasure. “Examining signs of driver sleepiness, usage of sleepiness countermeasures and the associations with sleepy driving behaviours and individual factors.” Watling et al. Accident Analysis and Prevention. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: Yawning, frequent blinking, and “dreamlike states of consciousness” are associated with continued sleepy driving and sleep-related near-accidents. As such, you guys might consider tracking these behaviors or alluding to them since it’s a real problem (that your device might address) that people continue to drive despite these behaviors. Drowsy Behavior Detection (2016) This is another driving simulation-based study. In this one, they fed data from the steering wheel and accelerator on the simulator to a complex computer algorithm that could calculate deviations from the desired path. This predicted strongly (almost 85% accuracy) for drowsy driving and was entirely non-invasive since it was based on data from the car’s mechanics. “Drowsy Behavior Detection Based on Driving Information.” Wang et al. International Journal of Automotive Technology. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: You don’t even need to track heart rate to monitor someone’s level of consciousness while the drive, but you guys could combine these technologies (computer analysis of driving data and physiological information) for an extra-accurate system. If you’re interested, here is a more recent article (with less accurate, although maybe more believable results) focusing on this same topic: [.pdf]. Detection of Fatigue (2016) This study looks at heart monitor tracing (ECG) in real drivers to assess drowsiness. It’s more invasive than the mechanical data from the car, but it’s also highly personizable and potentially more accurate. “Detection of Fatigue in Long-Distance Driving by Heart Rate Variability.”* 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: I’ll explain the EKG tracing above and how this study worked in person, but it’s neat to see that this is a legitimate way to potentially track sleepiness. Another, more recent, heart rate study on real roads confirms these results, and re-emphasizes that this approach would rely heavily on baseline (drowsy) measurements from the user: [.pdf]. Actually, in the past couple years, there have been a ton of these studies on heart rate and drowsy driving ([.pdf], [.pdf]), so I think you guys have a lot of really good scientific justification on your side. In fact, I found an article from a company with a prototype steering wheel integrating this technology [.pdf], but it looks like major automobile manufacturers gave up on this idea since wearable devices are so much better at tracking this kind of metric. Perhaps Sleepy Steery is a car-integrated wearable? Crash Risk Perception (2016) Since you guys are trying to prevent sleepy driving, it’s a good idea to understand how well-known this problem is. This study looks at risk perceptions of sleepy driving versus drunk driving and speeding. “Crash risk perception of sleepy driving and its comparisons with drunk driving and speeding: Which behavior is perceived as the riskiest?.”* 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: People may not take sleepy driving as seriously as is possible. This is both a challenge and an opportunity for you: Well-designed product function and a strong marketing campaign will make for a strong debut for your device, but if you don’t justify the dangers of drowsy driving, your target market might not be sufficiently convinced. Summary Recommendations Heart and respiratory rate are already good indicators of drowsy driving, but your accuracy might be improved even more by including additional metrics like an EKG (which can be a wearable or incorporated into the steering wheel) or behavior or mechanical (steering and acceleration) data. You also need to consider that people may not take sleepy driving as seriously as drunk driving (and you don’t really see people voluntarily installing Breathalyzers in their cars), so you should really aim to make a strong case that this is something people should care about and invest in.

["anxiety.html", "Anti-Anxiety Wearable Wearable Biofeedback Device (2013) Measuring Stress (2013) Stress Quantification (2016) Calming Effect of a Wearable (2017) Summary Recommendations", " Anti-Anxiety Wearable A wearable biofeedback device that monitors anxiety and intervenes when the user becomes stressed. Wearable Biofeedback Device (2013) Microsoft explored using a wearable butterfly (weird choice, I know) to report user stress and initiate active manipulation of the user’s affect (science jargon for “making themselves feel better”). Specifically, they measured electrical activity in the heart (an ECG) and electrical conductance in the skin (an EDA) to quantitate agitation. “MoodWings: A Wearable Biofeedback Device for Real- Time Stress Intervention.” MacLean et al. Microsoft Research. 2013. [.pdf] Big Idea: Users really liked the device, but it made them quantifiably more stressed. This might be important for you guys to keep in mind, since it doesn’t really matter if it makes you more stressed in an already-stressful situation, but it might be impractical for a user who wants to use it constantly. Measuring Stress (2013) This study used a smartphone-based Positive and Negative Affect Schedule survey and heart rate variability monitoring (which is calculated from ECG tracing) to measure employee stress at work. Their system wasn’t super accurate (maximum ~60%), but it endorses the idea of wearables for reliable measurement. “Towards Measuring Stress with Smartphones and Wearable Devices During Workday and Sleep.” Muaremi et al. BioNanoSci. 2013. [.pdf] Big Idea: The iPhone app isn’t a bad idea, although I think the survey is a cop-out. Rather, I think it’d be useful to be able to track your stress data on your phone and set notification preferences, etc. As for heart rate variability as a biofeedback metric, a more recent meta-analysis of 24 studies with 484 participants showed that HRV biofeedback training was “associated with a large reduction in self-reported stress.” [.pdf] Stress Quantification (2016) This is a really neat math paper that tracks heart rate, skin temperature, and galvanic skin response (an electric conductance test) to assign a numeric stress score. They gave users a wearable tracker and let them track their own stress reports over a period of several months, which showed that users self-educated on more effective stress relief techniques over time as they monitored their data. “Stress Quantification Using a Wearable Device for Daily Feedback to Improve Stress Management.” Mancilla et al. Springer International Publishing Switzerland. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: The two plots above are from a user’s data ~4 months apart. You guys might even consider using these figures as representative of your device’s effects in your project! This kind of wearable (monitoring HR, ST, and GSR) could be a wristwatch; other publications have explored measuring electrical activity in the brain (EEG) using wearables like glasses and headsets: [.pdf], but these were focused on “anxiety” more than the comparatively simple metric of “arousal” (interpreted as stress). Calming Effect of a Wearable (2017) This study looks at using a wristwatch-like device that delivers a slow pulsing beat to the user. You can read the study design below (it’s a classic scientific approach called a “single-blind”) and see the data they collected. It’s convincing! (And, this journal is super reputable and difficult to publish in.) “The calming effect of a new wearable device during the anticipation of public speech.” Azevedo et al. Nature Scientific Reports. 2017. [.pdf] Big Idea: This pulse system might be a good way to de-stress your user! They only measured reported anxiety and skin conductance, so it might be interesting to have your device record some additional metrics like skin temperature and heart rate. Summary Recommendations Constant stress-monitoring might increase short-term stress, which might be unacceptable for some demographics. However, short-term applications of stress intervention (like the calming effect of the doppel device above) might be highly effective. Additionally, there are quantitative approaches to measuring stress and evidence suggests that long-term monitoring might improve self-management of stress. Finally, the best metrics for measuring stress appear to be heart rate, skin temperature, and electrical skin conductance. "],
["pharmacy.html", "Pharmacy Robots Home Robots (2008) Intelligent Reminding (2009) Administration Devices (2016) Situated Agents (2016) Summary Recommendations", " Pharmacy Robots Devices designed to improve prescription adherence in elderly and otherwise noncompliant patients. Home Robots (2008) This paper outlines a robot designed to provide in-home elder care. Glance through it because it discuss some important usability considerations. “Home Robots and Ambient Facial Interfaces: Towards Building a Novel Telehealth Platform for Drug Compliance.” Takacs et al. TTeC. 2008. [.pdf] Big Idea: As you can see by the creepy baby face, this type of device (although unsightly) might be useful for patients with dementia since they have difficulty recognizing unfamiliar objects and text (validated by another creepy animated-face-based thesis work: [.pdf]). You might also consider incorporating their idea to activate the device with wearable sensors on the user so the product doesn’t rely on an elderly person’s ability to keep track of, for example, a swipe card. Intelligent Reminding (2009) Since noncompliance is a major cause of illness, treatment failure, and death in the United States, this study looks at what type of reminder is comparatively most effective. There were three reminder systems: baseline (no reminders), time-based (essentially, an alarm clock), and context-aware, which reminded users when they forgot to take their pill. “A Study of Medication-Taking and Unobtrusive, Intelligent Reminding.” Hayes * et al. Telemedicine and e-Health.* 2009. [.pdf] Big Idea: Context-based reminding was far more effective than time-based in terms of patient compliance, which might be an important consideration for your product. Do you want your users to trigger the device manually, do you want it to automatically dispense their prescription, or do you want some combination of the two? Which do you think is most effective? Administration Devices (2016) Other articles came out about the feasability of drug administration devices for the elderly before this one (example: [.pdf]), but none are as comprehensive. “Developing Drug Administration Devices for Geriatric Use.” Sam. American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: Think through this workflow with respect to your product design. Is it respectful of an elderly person’s ability to perceive and interact with it? Situated Agents (2016) This article comes from a series of publications (older articles: [.pdf], [.pdf]) on the subject of including stationary assistive technology devices (‘situated agents’) for improving both access and compliance to precription regimens in the elderly. “Situated Agents and Humans in Social Interaction for Elderly Healthcare.”* Sebastia et al. J Med Syst. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: There’s a whole ecosystem involved in the delivery and monitoring of these precriptions. Keep each player in the flowchart above in mind as you develop your technology! Summary Recommendations Elderly and demented patients might not be able to recognize most text or symbol-based imagery, and simply providing their pills on a timer is likely not the best way to promote adherence. Your users need to be able to engage with this device meaningfully (they need to want to use it), and there are more users than just the person taking the pills: don’t forget about the caregivers, clinicians, and pharmacists that are involved in the patient’s care! For inspiration, you might also take a look at some examples of futuristic pill-delivery systems online (1, 2) and a neat real-life company that turns prescriptions into to-do lists (article, company website).

["pms.html", "TENSE Therapy for Menstrual Pain General Comments Dysmenorrhea (2010) TENSE for Dysmenorrhea (2015) Topical Heat Patches (2015) Dysmenorrhea (2016) Multimodal Therapy (2018) Heat Therapy (2018) Summary Recommendations", " TENSE Therapy for Menstrual Pain A device to provide transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and electrothermal (TENSE) therapy for treating premenstrual syndrome and dysmenorrhea. General Comments I think you guys have a great idea. This product kind-of exists (it’s been patented, but I wouldn’t really worry about that because it doesn’t seem like they’ve ever tried to manufacture the device for this purpose), but I want you to think about marketing. Specifically, the most popular electronic device on Amazon for treating menstrual pain is “Livia: The Off Switch for Menstrual Pain,” which has 107 reviews (3.5-star rating) and costs $158. The best TENS/heating unit I can find is this Compex TENS/heat back wrap, which is advertised for “low back comfort and support…from exercise, household work, work or day-to-day activities…chronic pain management, intractable pain, and pain associated with arthritis.” No mention of menstrual pain anywhere. For comparison, this device costs $150 and has a 4.5-star rating, but only 8 reviews. My point here is that your idea (the TENSE unit, as I’m calling it) likely works better than exclusively TENS therapy, but the concept hasn’t been well-marketed to people suffering from menstrual pain. Dysmenorrhea (2010) This paper reviews causes, prevalence, presentation, and treatments for dysmenorrhea. It’s a really good summary on the problem you’re trying to solve and includes some commentary on using TENS for pain relief. “Dysmenorrhoea.” Wallace et al. The Obstetrician &amp; Gynaecologist. 2010. [.pdf] Big Idea: Somewhere between 50-100% of women experience menstrual pain, with some 10-15% of those cases being described as severe. This is a big problem that could use better solutions! From the article, TENS therapy was effective but spinal manipulation (from a chiropractor) was not. TENSE for Dysmenorrhea (2015) This is your idea in practice! It’s not the exact same device design, but it delivers combined TENS and thermotherapy. From the conclusion, “the combination of hf-TENS and thermotherapy was effective in relieving acute pain in women with moderate or severe primary dysmenorrhea.” “Efficacy of the device combining high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and thermotherapy for relieving primary dysmenorrhea: a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial.” Lee et al. European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: So, your product is effective, but it’s also important to justify it compared to other treatment approaches. NSAIDs (anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and asprin) can cause GI bleeding, nausea, kidney dysfunction, and hepatotoxicity (liver damage); TENS and heat therapy really can’t do any damage beyond causing redness or tingling. Make sure to emphasize that this is an extremely safe, non-pharmacologic approach! If you’re interested, here is another study that also shows effective pain relief with TENS, and here is an article that looks at kinesio taping and hots packs for treating PMS pain (more non-pharmacological interventions). Topical Heat Patches (2015) This is an “evidence-based medicine review,” meaning it examines some previous randomized control trials (actual experiments on patients) and looks at whether they reported consistent findings or not. I think I talked to you guys about the difference between meta-analyses and reviews (meta-analyses do statistical analysis on the combined data from the different studies). “Are Topical Heat Patches More Effective at Relieving Pain Associated With Dysmenorrhea Than OTC NSAIDs (Ibuprofen 400 mg PO Q8h or Acetaminophen 500 mg PO Q6h) in Menstruating Women 18 and Over?” Murray. PCOM Physician Assistant Studies Student Scholarship. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: Heating by itself isn’t conclusively better than NSAIDs, but some evidence supported that it provided greater relief from menstrual pain. More importantly, heating isn’t associated with nearly as many adverse events as NSAID use and it’s probably cheaper in the long term. Dysmenorrhea (2016) Another review of dysmenorrhhea prevalence, causes, and treatments. I really only include this because of the last few paragraphs: “Dysmenorrhoea.” Stewart. Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Reproductive Medicine. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: Essentially, exercise, relaxation, and spinal manipulation (from a chiropractor) aren’t effective long-term treatments for menstrual pain, but TENS and heating probably are. Multimodal Therapy (2018) This is an interesting example of what you might consider “junk science” (no offense to the authors). It’s a largely unremarkable single-patient study (seeing as we’ve already looked at other papers that used spinal manipulation, TENS, and heating), and it doesn’t contribute anything novel to the literature. That said, it corroborates your idea and has quantitative pain measures, so you might give it a look. “Multimodal Therapy Combining Spinal Manipulation, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation, and Heat for Primary Dysmenorrhea: A Prospective Case Study.” Wong et al. Journal of Chiropractic Medicine. 2018. [.pdf] Big Idea: This combination of conservative, non-pharmacologic therapies worked for this 27-year-old woman, but remember: a more-reliable source mentioned that spinal manipulation did not have a significant effect on pain reduction. Heat Therapy (2018) I remember talking to you guys about systematic reviews and meta-analyses (one summarizes the collective results other papers reported, the other does statistical analysis on their collected data). This is both! “Heat therapy for primary dysmenorrhea: A systematic review and meta-analysis of its effects on pain relief and quality of life.” Jo et al. Scientific Reports. 2018. [.pdf] Big Idea: Essentially, this is just great data supporting your idea of including a heating element. These collective studies identified comparative advantages for heat therapy as compared to a placebo, analgesics (like Advil), and no treatment. Summary Recommendations Most importantly, emphasize how effective this product could be for your target market. Clearly, this is something existing companies have failed to do (see my general comments). PMS and dymenorrheal pain are huge problems (like, a majority of more than half the planet experiences them), and NSAIDs (asprin, Tylenol, etc.) can cause many adverse health effects. Heating and TENS therapy (TENSE, as I’m calling it) are associated with moderately succcessful pain relief (comparable or better than currently-popular therapies) and essentially no adverse events. This is your selling point, so be sure to own it! "],
["football.html", "Football Helmets Topological Optimization (2016) Kinematic Measuring Device (2016) Inadequate Helmet Fit (2016) Cumulative Helmet Impacts (2016) Newer Helmet Designs (2018) Summary Recommendations", " Football Helmets Improved helmet designs for impact detection, monitoring, and reporting to prevent CTE, improve concussion protocols, and reduce injury in football players. Topological Optimization (2016) Topology has to do with geometric analysis of a surface (like an altitude map), so this paper is looking at optimizing the surface of the football helmet to reduce tensile pressures and shear strains inside the helmet/brain. “Constrained topological optimization of a football helmet facemask based on brain response.” Johnson et al. Materials and Design. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: You might look at the figures in this paper or consider using them in your presentation as rationale for the design of your helmet. This kind of data is very compelling when you can quantitatively show that you’ve reduced the stresses the brain will experience. Kinematic Measuring Device (2016) Simply put, this is an example of where you might put your measuring device. These researchers installed their g-force tracker inside the padding at the top of the helmet, and the data they recorded was useful for analysis. “Laboratory Evaluation of the gForce Tracker, a Head Impact Kinematic Measuring Device for Use in Football Helmets.” Campbell et al. Annals of Biomedical Engineering. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: There’s a growing (and urgent) interest in monitoring the severity of concussive and subconcussive head impacts in youth, amateur, and professional football players. This gives you one example of a demonstrably reliable method to take kinematic measurements in real time. To get really fancy, you might consider proposing a combination of this technology and the nancomposite foam sensors described in this paper for an ultra-robust measurement technique. Inadequate Helmet Fit (2016) If your helmet doesn’t fit well, you’re more likely to get a severe concussion (or a worse subconcussive impact). “Inadequate Helmet Fit Increases Concussion Severity in American High School Football Players.” Greenhill et al. Annals of Biomedical Engineering. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: This might be another angle for you guys to take on this idea — “governing bodies” (maybe, even on a federal level) should be involved in regulating these helmets. You might include in your presentation an idea about writing a position paper or hiring a lobbying company to market the idea that people need your helmets (in a real sense, because they are safer) and that there should be subsidized funding in place to make that possible for all students. Just a thought! Cumulative Helmet Impacts (2016) This study will give you guys a really strong idea of which variables you need to measure to be able to accurately estimate changes in clinical features like white matter volume (which, as we discussed, might be important for getting players to relevant medical or psychiatric care before it’s too late). “Novel Method of Weighting Cumulative Helmet Impacts Improves Correlation with Brain White Matter Changes After One Football Season of Sub-concussive Head Blows.” Merchant-Borna et al. Annals of Biomedical Engineering. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: I know this equation looks super daunting, but it’s just to show that you can actually assign a value to the combined quantity and severity of the hits, weighted for time between head impacts and time until assessment. Newer Helmet Designs (2018) It’s important to really justify an expensive and high-tech helmet design. We know that poorly fitting helmets can make concussions worse, but can a nice helmet decrease your risk of being concussed? “Do newer football helmet designs reduce the risk of sports-related concussion?.” Gherman et al. Evidence-Based Practice. 2018. [.pdf] Big Idea: It’s pretty much what we’d expect, but we still want to have reliable evidence to support our claims. Otherwise, our target buyers have to just “take our word,” and it’s not likely that they’ll do that since we’re newcomers to the market. Summary Recommendations You guys already knew about Xenith Helmets, so I think you’re on the right track in terms of taking inspiration from existing designs. Contouring the inside and outside of the helmet (its topology) in an optimal way will minimize forces on the brain (poorer helmet fit can make concussions worse). You’ve got options in terms of your measurement technology, since you can indirectly calculate white matter changes (with nasty math) while directly assessing acceleration with a gForce tracker or the nanocomposite foam sensors. However you choose to approach the tech, this is a hot-button item, especially as it relates to measuring, treating, and preventing CTE in younger athletes. "],
["uvdetection.html", "UV Detection Jewelry General Comments UV Radiation (2002) Existing Technologies (2016) Summary Recommendations", " UV Detection Jewelry Multi-purpose jewelry that monitors and displays UV exposure for sunburn and skin cancer prevention. General Comments I think the key for your project is going to be justifying that your product will be somehow better than existing technologies (which doesn’t need to mean that it works better — maybe it just appeals more to your target market than other products). UV-sensitive plastics, like these beads, are a cost-effective and simple method for reporting UV exposure to the user, but frankly, they’re kind of tacky. On the opposite end of the spectrum, wearable devices with smartphone apps set the current bar for style and function (here is that company’s patent, if you’re interested). For more examples of wearable UV exposure monitors, check out this page. UV Radiation (2002) First off, you should have a strong understanding of the problem. UV rays can cause DNA damage, which eventually can cause cancer. You’re planning on measuring UV exposure and reporting it to the user, so you should be able to explain who you want to measure, what you’re measuring, and how you’re going to measure it. “Sources and measurement of ultraviolet radiation.” Diffey. Academic Press Methods. 2002. [.pdf] Existing Technologies (2016) Other than the plastic beads and the wearable device (“Ultra”) mentioned above, there are a ton of ways to monitor sun exposure in both single and multi-use systems. “A Paper Based Sensor for Monitoring Sun Exposure.” Khiabani et al. ACS Sensors. 2016. [.pdf] So, you can use a single-use, degradable, paper-based system to monitor UV exposure, but that’s not really what you guys are trying to do (although it could be a low-cost alternative that you offer). Why might this option not be as good as a permanent solution like your jewelry? I also think that this paper makes a good point about different skin types (check out the Fitzpatrick skin scale). “Multifunctional anthraquinone-based sensors: UV, O2 and time.” Khankaewa et al. Sensors and Actuators. 2016. [.pdf] Again, this isn’t reusable, but it’s a good chemical indicator. You might also notice that they specify that this technology is for Fitzpatrick skin type II, which is a good reminder that not all measurement techniques are accurate between different ethnicities. “Validation and in vivo assessment of an innovative satellite-based solar UV dosimeter for a mobile app dedicated to skin health.” Morelli et al. Photochemical &amp; Photobiological Sciences. 2016. [.pdf] This is a really neat idea, and this company appears to be viable and growing based on their website (they recently posted job listings, but their app isn’t available on the Apple app store). Perhaps you could include a similar feature in the app if your user forgets their wearable device? There’s also an important lesson here. If we turn to the literature, we’ll find this article: “Smartphone applications for melanoma detection by community, patient and generalist clinician users: a review.” Kassianos et al. British Journal of Dermatology. 2015. [.pdf] So, maybe this idea doesn’t actually work as well as it claims because it fails to incorporate physician advice or some other element like risk assessment. Finally, you might use some combination of different technologies (or, as I’ve mentioned, have products at different price points, since these options are largely single-use disposables), like this chemical Summary Recommendations "],
