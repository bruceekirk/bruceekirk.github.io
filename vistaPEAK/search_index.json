You can navigate from this page to individual project pages using the sidebar, which you can hide by clicking the icon in the top left corner of the page. Every project section ends with a summary recommendation. Some projects have more linked articles than others, but this has nothing to do with the quality of any project. Rather, some projects lend themselves more readily to being justified by academic research; some projects are based more on common sense or solving an industry-specific problem. You guys are all doing a great job and I’m impressed with everyone’s hard work. A note on academic research: These papers can be tough to approach. They’re densely formatted and full of jargon, but they’re still an important resource. I’ve done my best to pick the most relevant elements out of these articles for you guys, but I’d challenge you to read through a few of them and see if you find anything interesting. This kind of peer-reviewed literature is difficult to publish and requires a significantly deeper understanding of the subject material than any other form of writing. If you’re looking for the truth, these kinds of articles (which you can easily find on Google Scholar) are where to look. Remember! Sometimes, new investigations change the way we think about something scientifically. Generally speaking, the most recently published high-quality research is usually a good first resource. As always, feel free to contact me with any questions you might have about working in science and medicine or attending college, medical school, or graduate school: bruce.kirkpatrick@colorado.edu. One other thing: I might’ve made mistakes in putting these together. If you find typos or incorrectly-linked pages that need clarification or correction, just let me know. "],
["alzheimers.html", "Alzheimer’s App Mobile App Development (2013) Universal Design (2015) Mobile Reminders (2015) Protecting Cognition (2016) Brain Plasticity (2017) Promise of Technology (2018) Summary Recommendations", " Alzheimer’s App A mobile application designed for cognitive training and reminders for elderly patients with neurodegenerative conditions (i.e. Alzheimer’s disease) and status updates for their families. Mobile App Development (2013) This paper supports your idea that a mobile app could be useful for Alzheimer’s patients. It also does a great job outlining the challenges you might encounter in implementing this idea. “Mobile App Development and Usability Research to Help Dementia and Alzheimer Patients.” Yamagata et al. Institute of Electical and Electronics Engineers. 2013. [.pdf] Big Idea: People with Alzheimer’s can get agitated, especially in the evening, but some evidence supports that they can be comforted by visual and auditory stimulation. Keep in mind: these patients might have dementia-related issues with fine motor coordination, so your app design needs to be very easy to physically navigate. Universal Design (2015) You guys can take inspiration from this paper addressing different elements of the neurodegenerative experience with app functions: “Universal Design with Mobile App Development: Bridging the Gap for the Forgotten Populations.” Nezerwa et al. Institute of Electical and Electronics Engineers. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: There are already some good examples of apps to draw from, especially in terms of consolidating features. This paper emphasizes that auditory and visual stimulation are both needed for optimal cognitive stimulation! If you have time, glance through this one. Mobile Reminders (2015) This is actually not a great paper (it’s written in pretty broken English), but it has some good ideas regarding a system that allows family members to track food, water, and prescription medication intake. “A Mobile Reminder System for Elderly and Alzheimer’s patients.” Dalbouh et al. International Journal of Computer Science Issues. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: You’ve got a lot of good options in terms of user interface design and functionality, and it’s a great selling point that deploying this kind of app through the App Store makes for a far broader reach than physician-centered care. Protecting Cognition (2016) This paper actually used a computer-based cognitive training tool to confirm that it had a positive memory effect in Alzheimer’s patients. “Protecting cognition from aging and Alzheimer’s disease: a computerized cognitive training combined with reminiscence therapy.” Barban et al. International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: This just quantifies that your idea could improve functional abilities in Alzheimer’s disease patients. Check out this paper if you’re interested in what they included in their cognitive training. Brain Plasticity (2017) This study uses functional MRI to demonstrate that cognitive training slows down Alzheimer’s disease progression. It’s a super-dense paper, but it’s good evidence that this app would actually work. “A Pilot Study on Brain Plasticity of Functional Connectivity Modulated by Cognitive Training in Mild Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment.” Barban et al. Brain Sciences. 2017. [.pdf] Big Idea: The figures and text are both so intensely science-y in this paper that I’m not going to bother including either, but it showed that cognitive training improved “whole-brain functional connectivity in subjects at risk of developing AD and in patients during the early stages of this disease.” Promise of Technology (2018) This is a full thesis (almost 70 pages long), but it has a lot of great content. Specifically, it has a well-researched 5-page review of current technologies relating to improving cognition in Alzheimer’s disease and a research proposal including cognitive training, physical training, companionship, and daily task reminders. “Seniors Living with Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia: The Promise of App Technology.” Lu. Major Papers. 2018. [.pdf] Big Idea: No figures or text from this one, either, but it justifies that seniors are increasingly adept at using technology (and so diseases of the elderly like dementia should be addressed with technology). Summary Recommendations People with Alzheimer’s disease (and those elderly patients who are at risk of developing the disease) benefit from combined visual and auditory stimulation, especially during periods of agitation (“sundowning” at dusk). Look through examples in the literature regarding app design and function and come up with a blend of app capabilities informed by the needs of these patients. Don’t forget – elderly people with dementia will probably struggle to use a touchscreen, so this needs to be as easy to navigate as is possible. "],
["walker.html", "Multi-Surface Walker General Comments Mobility and Quality of Life (2011) Enhancing Independence (2013) Walking Aids and Falls (2015) Walking in Relation to Mortality (2018) Summary Recommendations", " Multi-Surface Walker A walking mobility device designed for the active elderly in multi-surface applications including indoor, outdoor, and icy surfaces. General Comments There are some cool ideas out there related to improving walker/rollator technology. One example is these easily attachable walker “skis:” A similar technology exists for rollators: You guys might also check out these webpages: luxury rollators and walkers and an advanced walker safety system, as well as the brochure for an “active rollator.” Mobility and Quality of Life (2011) This paper shows that mobility is highly correlated with quality of life and feelings of autonomy, which is great foundational evidence that an improved walker design could benefit elderly patients both physically and psychiatrically. “Mobility and quality of life in elderly and geriatric patients.” Hudakova et al. International Journal of Nursing and Midwifery. 2011. [.pdf] Big Idea: There’s an enormous (and growing) aging and elderly population. Since evidence supports that mobility is important for quality of life, we need to enable seniors to live well by providing the best possible supportive technology. Enhancing Independence (2013) This is a high-effort thesis with lots of thought put towards design. You should glance through it for inspiration, since it’s working towards the same concept as your project. “Enhancing the Independence and Mobility for the Elderly and Disabled: A New Approach for Older Users.” Henriksen. Massey University. 2013. [.pdf] Big Idea: You might consider a walk/ride (or at least walk/sit) capability for your walker. Old people get tired quickly, especially when they’re engaging in physical activity! Walking Aids and Falls (2015) This study looks at whether using a walking aid predicts for future falls. Turns out, using aids (walkers, rollators, wheelchairs) is a risk factor for falling in the future! “Understanding the Relationship Between Walking Aids and Falls in Older Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study.” de Mettelinge et al. Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: If using a walking aid is a positive predictor for future falls, you’d want the safest possible walking aid to prevent such an occurence, right? Keep this in mind with your design! Walking in Relation to Mortality (2018) Does walking (or engaging in some amount of physical activity) as an older person actually improve your chance for survival? This study shows, pretty convincingly, that it does. “Walking in Relation to Mortality in a Large Prospective Cohort of Older U.S. Adults.” Patel et al. American Journal of Preventive Medicine. 2018. [.pdf] Big Idea: Scooters might be safer than walkers, but being sedentary (not getting any physical activity) increases your likelihood of dying sooner as an elderly person. Summary Recommendations Check out the examples I linked of existing high-quality multi-surface walkers and rollators. You might find some good ideas to include in your project! Big takeaways from the research are: Older people are happier and live longer when they’re active and more independent (both of which might be enabled with a walker or similar walking aid). At the same time, using a walking aid positively predicts for future falls, so you need to be careful in your design to maximize safety for the user. "],
["sleepy.html", "Sleepy Steery Drowsiness Estimation (2015) Sleepy Driving Behaviours (2015) Drowsy Behavior Detection (2016) Detection of Fatigue (2016) Crash Risk Perception (2016) Summary Recommendations", " Sleepy Steery A heart-rate monitoring device intended to monitor and prevent sleepy driving. Drowsiness Estimation (2015) This investigation looked at eight young (early 20s) men’s heart and respiratory rates as they drove four 50-minute sessions in a simulator after eating a big meal. By tracking these physiologic parameters, the study was able to determine how accurate they were for predicting drowsiness. “Drowsiness Estimation Under Driving Environment by Heart Rate Variability and/or Breathing Rate Variability with Logistic Regression Analysis.” Igasaki et al. International Conference on BioMedical Engineering and Informatics. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: 81% accuracy between the two parameters is pretty good! With this in mind, you might want to measure respiratory rate in addition to heart rate with your device. Sleepy Driving Behaviours (2015) Drowsiness is indicated by factors beyond heart and respiratory rate. This paper looks at some of them and examines whether or not they predict for a driver’s use of a sleepiness countermeasure. “Examining signs of driver sleepiness, usage of sleepiness countermeasures and the associations with sleepy driving behaviours and individual factors.” Watling et al. Accident Analysis and Prevention. 2015. [.pdf] Big Idea: Yawning, frequent blinking, and “dreamlike states of consciousness” are associated with continued sleepy driving and sleep-related near-accidents. As such, you guys might consider tracking these behaviors or alluding to them since it’s a real problem (that your device might address) that people continue to drive despite these behaviors. Drowsy Behavior Detection (2016) This is another driving simulation-based study. In this one, they fed data from the steering wheel and accelerator on the simulator to a complex computer algorithm that could calculate deviations from the desired path. This predicted strongly (almost 85% accuracy) for drowsy driving and was entirely non-invasive since it was based on data from the car’s mechanics. “Drowsy Behavior Detection Based on Driving Information.” Wang et al. International Journal of Automotive Technology. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: You don’t even need to track heart rate to monitor someone’s level of consciousness while the drive, but you guys could combine these technologies (computer analysis of driving data and physiological information) for an extra-accurate system. If you’re interested, here is a more recent article (with less accurate, although maybe more believable results) focusing on this same topic: [.pdf]. Detection of Fatigue (2016) This study looks at heart monitor tracing (ECG) in real drivers to assess drowsiness. It’s more invasive than the mechanical data from the car, but it’s also highly personizable and potentially more accurate. “Detection of Fatigue in Long-Distance Driving by Heart Rate Variability.”* 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: I’ll explain the EKG tracing above and how this study worked in person, but it’s neat to see that this is a legitimate way to potentially track sleepiness. Another, more recent, heart rate study on real roads confirms these results, and re-emphasizes that this approach would rely heavily on baseline (drowsy) measurements from the user: [.pdf]. Actually, in the past couple years, there have been a ton of these studies on heart rate and drowsy driving ([.pdf], [.pdf]), so I think you guys have a lot of really good scientific justification on your side. In fact, I found an article from a company with a prototype steering wheel integrating this technology [.pdf], but it looks like major automobile manufacturers gave up on this idea since wearable devices are so much better at tracking this kind of metric. Perhaps Sleepy Steery is a car-integrated wearable? Crash Risk Perception (2016) Since you guys are trying to prevent sleepy driving, it’s a good idea to understand how well-known this problem is. This study looks at risk perceptions of sleepy driving versus drunk driving and speeding. “Crash risk perception of sleepy driving and its comparisons with drunk driving and speeding: Which behavior is perceived as the riskiest?.”* 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: People may not take sleepy driving as seriously as is possible. This is both a challenge and an opportunity for you: Well-designed product function and a strong marketing campaign will make for a strong debut for your device, but if you don’t justify the dangers of drowsy driving, your target market might not be sufficiently convinced. Summary Recommendations Heart and respiratory rate are already good indicators of drowsy driving, but your accuracy might be improved even more by including additional metrics like an EKG (which can be a wearable or incorporated into the steering wheel) or behavior or mechanical (steering and acceleration) data. You also need to consider that people may not take sleepy driving as seriously as drunk driving (and you don’t really see people voluntarily installing Breathalyzers in their cars), so you should really aim to make a strong case that this is something people should care about and invest in.

["anxiety.html", "Anti-Anxiety Wearable Wearable Biofeedback Device (2013) Measuring Stress (2013) Stress Quantification (2016) Calming Effect of a Wearable (2017) Summary Recommendations", " Anti-Anxiety Wearable A wearable biofeedback device that monitors anxiety and intervenes when the user becomes stressed. Wearable Biofeedback Device (2013) Microsoft explored using a wearable butterfly (weird choice, I know) to report user stress and initiate active manipulation of the user’s affect (science jargon for “making themselves feel better”). Specifically, they measured electrical activity in the heart (an ECG) and electrical conductance in the skin (an EDA) to quantitate agitation. “MoodWings: A Wearable Biofeedback Device for Real- Time Stress Intervention.” MacLean et al. Microsoft Research. 2013. [.pdf] Big Idea: Users really liked the device, but it made them quantifiably more stressed. This might be important for you guys to keep in mind, since it doesn’t really matter if it makes you more stressed in an already-stressful situation, but it might be impractical for a user who wants to use it constantly. Measuring Stress (2013) This study used a smartphone-based Positive and Negative Affect Schedule survey and heart rate variability monitoring (which is calculated from ECG tracing) to measure employee stress at work. Their system wasn’t super accurate (maximum ~60%), but it endorses the idea of wearables for reliable measurement. “Towards Measuring Stress with Smartphones and Wearable Devices During Workday and Sleep.” Muaremi et al. BioNanoSci. 2013. [.pdf] Big Idea: The iPhone app isn’t a bad idea, although I think the survey is a cop-out. Rather, I think it’d be useful to be able to track your stress data on your phone and set notification preferences, etc. As for heart rate variability as a biofeedback metric, a more recent meta-analysis of 24 studies with 484 participants showed that HRV biofeedback training was “associated with a large reduction in self-reported stress.” [.pdf] Stress Quantification (2016) This is a really neat math paper that tracks heart rate, skin temperature, and galvanic skin response (an electric conductance test) to assign a numeric stress score. They gave users a wearable tracker and let them track their own stress reports over a period of several months, which showed that users self-educated on more effective stress relief techniques over time as they monitored their data. “Stress Quantification Using a Wearable Device for Daily Feedback to Improve Stress Management.” Mancilla et al. Springer International Publishing Switzerland. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: The two plots above are from a user’s data ~4 months apart. You guys might even consider using these figures as representative of your device’s effects in your project! This kind of wearable (monitoring HR, ST, and GSR) could be a wristwatch; other publications have explored measuring electrical activity in the brain (EEG) using wearables like glasses and headsets: [.pdf], but these were focused on “anxiety” more than the comparatively simple metric of “arousal” (interpreted as stress). Calming Effect of a Wearable (2017) This study looks at using a wristwatch-like device that delivers a slow pulsing beat to the user. You can read the study design below (it’s a classic scientific approach called a “single-blind”) and see the data they collected. It’s convincing! (And, this journal is super reputable and difficult to publish in.) “The calming effect of a new wearable device during the anticipation of public speech.” Azevedo et al. Nature Scientific Reports. 2017. [.pdf] Big Idea: This pulse system might be a good way to de-stress your user! They only measured reported anxiety and skin conductance, so it might be interesting to have your device record some additional metrics like skin temperature and heart rate. Summary Recommendations Constant stress-monitoring might increase short-term stress, which might be unacceptable for some demographics. However, short-term applications of stress intervention (like the calming effect of the doppel device above) might be highly effective. Additionally, there are quantitative approaches to measuring stress and evidence suggests that long-term monitoring might improve self-management of stress. Finally, the best metrics for measuring stress appear to be heart rate, skin temperature, and electrical skin conductance. "],
["pharmacy.html", "Pharmacy Robots Home Robots (2008) Intelligent Reminding (2009) Administration Devices (2016) Situated Agents (2016) Summary Recommendations", " Pharmacy Robots Devices designed to improve prescription adherence in elderly and otherwise noncompliant patients. Home Robots (2008) This paper outlines a robot designed to provide in-home elder care. Glance through it because it discuss some important usability considerations. “Home Robots and Ambient Facial Interfaces: Towards Building a Novel Telehealth Platform for Drug Compliance.” Takacs et al. TTeC. 2008. [.pdf] Big Idea: As you can see by the creepy baby face, this type of device (although unsightly) might be useful for patients with dementia since they have difficulty recognizing unfamiliar objects and text (validated by another creepy animated-face-based thesis work: [.pdf]). You might also consider incorporating their idea to activate the device with wearable sensors on the user so the product doesn’t rely on an elderly person’s ability to keep track of, for example, a swipe card. Intelligent Reminding (2009) Since noncompliance is a major cause of illness, treatment failure, and death in the United States, this study looks at what type of reminder is comparatively most effective. There were three reminder systems: baseline (no reminders), time-based (essentially, an alarm clock), and context-aware, which reminded users when they forgot to take their pill. “A Study of Medication-Taking and Unobtrusive, Intelligent Reminding.” Hayes * et al. Telemedicine and e-Health.* 2009. [.pdf] Big Idea: Context-based reminding was far more effective than time-based in terms of patient compliance, which might be an important consideration for your product. Do you want your users to trigger the device manually, do you want it to automatically dispense their prescription, or do you want some combination of the two? Which do you think is most effective? Administration Devices (2016) Other articles came out about the feasability of drug administration devices for the elderly before this one (example: [.pdf]), but none are as comprehensive. “Developing Drug Administration Devices for Geriatric Use.” Sam. American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: Think through this workflow with respect to your product design. Is it respectful of an elderly person’s ability to perceive and interact with it? Situated Agents (2016) This article comes from a series of publications (older articles: [.pdf], [.pdf]) on the subject of including stationary assistive technology devices (‘situated agents’) for improving both access and compliance to precription regimens in the elderly. “Situated Agents and Humans in Social Interaction for Elderly Healthcare.”* Sebastia et al. J Med Syst. 2016. [.pdf] Big Idea: There’s a whole ecosystem involved in the delivery and monitoring of these precriptions. Keep each player in the flowchart above in mind as you develop your technology! Summary Recommendations Elderly and demented patients might not be able to recognize most text or symbol-based imagery, and simply providing their pills on a timer is likely not the best way to promote adherence. Your users need to be able to engage with this device meaningfully (they need to want to use it), and there are more users than just the person taking the pills: don’t forget about the caregivers, clinicians, and pharmacists that are involved in the patient’s care! For inspiration, you might also take a look at some examples of futuristic pill-delivery systems online (1, 2) and a neat real-life company that turns prescriptions into to-do lists (article, company website).
